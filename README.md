# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll

## Project Description

Welcome to the Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll! This project involves creating Python scripts to analyze financial and election data, showcasing the data processing and analysis skills. The two challenges, PyBank and PyPoll, require you to process CSV files, perform calculations, and generate insightful reports.
## PyBank

The PyBank challenge focuses on analyzing financial records to gain insights into the company's financial performance. The dataset, `budget_data.csv`, contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". Your task is to develop a Python script that calculates the following key metrics:

1. **Total Months:** Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.
2. **Net Total:** Determine the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3. **Average Change:** Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then compute the average of those changes.
4. **Greatest Increase:** Identify the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. **Greatest Decrease:** Identify the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final analysis is both printed to the terminal and exported to a text file named `financial_analysis.txt`.

## PyPoll

The PyPoll assignment focuses on modernizing the vote-counting process for a small, rural town. The provided dataset, `election_data.csv`, includes columns for "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to develop a Python script that calculates the following election-related insights:

1. **Total Votes:** Calculate the total number of votes cast in the election.
2. **Candidates List:** Create a list of candidates who received votes.
3. **Percentage and Total Votes:** Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won and determine the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. **Winner Determination:** Identify the winner of the election based on popular vote.

The election analysis is presented in the terminal and exported to a text file named `election_results.txt`.

## About the Python `csv` Module

Both the PyBank and PyPoll modules leverage the power of the Python `csv` module, a built-in library that facilitates efficient processing of CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. This module provides robust capabilities for reading and writing structured data in CSV format, which is a common and widely used format for tabular data representation.

The `csv` module offers various functionalities to handle CSV files effectively:

- **Reading Data:** Using the `csv.reader` class, you can easily read data from CSV files. This class provides methods to iterate through rows and columns, allowing you to extract data points for analysis.

- **Writing Data:** The `csv.writer` class enables you to write data to CSV files. It offers methods to construct rows with appropriate formatting and delimiters.

- **Custom Delimiters:** The module supports customization of delimiters, allowing you to handle CSV files with different separators like tabs or semicolons.

Using the `csv` module streamlines tasks such as parsing data, handling edge cases, and ensuring data integrity. It's a valuable tool for working with structured data and is particularly useful in scenarios like data preprocessing, analysis, and reporting, as demonstrated in the PyBank and PyPoll challenges.

By utilizing the Python `csv` module, the assignments showcase industry-standard practices for handling and manipulating CSV data, contributing to the proficiency in data manipulation and analysis techniques.


## Accessing the Files

To access the files in this GitHub repository and explore the PyBank and PyPoll assignments:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and use the following command:
                         git clone <repository_url>

Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to Assignment Folders:**
- **PyBank:** Navigate to the `PyBank` folder. This folder contains the Python script `main.py` for the PyBank assignment.
  - Location: `python-challenge/PyBank/`
- **PyPoll:** Navigate to the `PyPoll` folder. This folder contains the Python script `main.py` for the PyPoll assignment.
  - Location: `python-challenge/PyPoll/`

3. **CSV Data and Analysis Results:**
- **Resources Folder:** Inside each folder, you'll find a `Resources` folder that contains the CSV data file (`budget_data.csv` for PyBank and `election_data.csv` for PyPoll).
  - Location: `python-challenge/PyBank/Resources/` and `python-challenge/PyPoll/Resources/`
- **Analysis Folder:** The analysis results, such as the financial analysis report for PyBank and the election results for PyPoll, are saved in the `analysis` folder within each assignment folder.
  - Location: `python-challenge/PyBank/analysis/` and `python-challenge/PyPoll/analysis/`

4. **Running the Scripts:**
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the respective assignment folder (`PyBank` or `PyPoll`).
- Run the script using the following command:

  ```
  python main.py
  ```
  This will execute the script and display the analysis in the terminal.
## Test Cases with Partial Datasets

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the PyBank and PyPoll scripts, test cases were conducted using partial datasets. These test cases involve smaller subsets of data, represented by `budget_data_few.csv` for PyBank and `election_data_few.csv` for PyPoll. These partial datasets are designed to simulate real-world scenarios and allow for thorough script validation.

1. **PyBank Test Case (`budget_data_few.csv`):**
   - The partial dataset includes a limited number of financial records.
   - It features a smaller timeframe and fewer profit/loss entries.
   - This test case validates the functionality of the PyBank script with reduced data.

2. **PyPoll Test Case (`election_data_few.csv`):**
   - The partial dataset contains a subset of voter records.
   - It showcases a simplified election scenario with fewer candidates and votes.
   - This test case ensures the PyPoll script's accuracy with a condensed election dataset.

## Conclusion

The PyBank and PyPoll challengs not only showcase your data analysis and manipulation skills but also demonstrate your ability to work with CSV files, extract insights, and present results effectively. By thoroughly testing the scripts with both complete and partial datasets, you ensure their reliability across various data scenarios.
